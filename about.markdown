I became interested in engineering because I wanted to know how music gear and recording equipment worked. I studied
electrical engineering with a focus on analog electronics and music technology. After college, I became a wireless
engineer. During my time working on LTE and 5G-NR, I discovered my passion for software development. I am currently
building cloud-native solutions for inventory forecasting. I don't know what's next.
